#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Refers to the process of designing,developing, and maintaining softwares. Software development has brought about customer delivery whereby there is improved customer experience with the ongoing technology. 
Foster Inoovation and Creativity- software engineering has come about with different innovations in the creative world thus impacting the delivery support in the technological frameworks. 
Improved efficiency- software engineering has really improved efficiency in production industries where by we get realtime and readily available decisional support.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The birth of software Engineering
software engineering was born in 11968- the event emphasizes the need for systematic approaches to software development leading to adoption of engineering principles such as structured programming and modular design.

The rise of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) 
this was initiated between 1980s-1990s. Cocepts such as inheritance, encapsulation were introduces making softwares more moduular, reliable and maintainable. Languages like c++ and Java became popular enabling developers to build complec applications more efficiently.

The Agile Manifesto and Agile Development 
(2001) Agile manifestos such as Scrum and Kanban emphasize iterative development, customer collaboration and adaptability to change. It promotes flexibility, continous delivery and team collaboration.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Software development life  cycle
Planning- refers to defining the project goals, the scope , feasibility, the risk and resource allocation to ensure the success of the project.
Requirement analysis- this is where the stakeholders gather and document functional and non-functional requirements which serve as a blueprint for development.
Design- Designing of the software is then implemented where the developers create high-end and defined system designs specifying the system architecture and the user interfaces.
Implementation- After the software has been designed, the developers write the actual code based on the design specifications using programming languages and frameworks.
Testing- the software is then tested through a rigirous testing process to identify and fix defects.
Deployment- refers to the release of the tested software to production environments either as full launch or in phases.
Maintenance and Support- this is where the outgoing software updates, bug fixes and enhancements are performed to ensure the software remains functional and efficient.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology works best for projects with clear requirements, minimum expected changes and well defined goals.
Agile on  the other side is ideal for projects that require flexible, rapid iterations and ongoing customer feedback.
waterfall is linear and sequential while Agile is iterative and increamental.
waterfall is rigid in terms of flexibility whereby changes are difficult to implement whereas Agile is highly adaptable to changes.
The testing of waterfall is done after the development is completed while Agile testing is integrated into each iteration. 
In waterfall, extensive documentation is required while in Agile minimum documentation is required with focus based on the working of the software.
Examples In waterfall: Construction projects where each phase depends on the complition of the previous phase.
                      In healthcare and aerospace systems where regulatory compliance and extensive documentation are required.
Examples in Agile include: Mobile app development where user feedback influences the updates and feature release.
                          Software startups where market demands change frequently requiring continous adaptation.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Roles of a software developer
Software designing- wrighting clean, efficient and maintainable code based on the system requirement.
Requirement analysis
Testing and debugging- a software developer is responsible for testing the software kdesigned and debugging all the possible bugs that might corrupt the system.
Code review- A software developer is responsible for reviewing the codes written to ensure the efficientt and effictiveness of the written codes

Roles of a quality assurance engineer
Test Planning- A QA is responsible to planning how the testing of the designed software is going to be conducted and how it is conducted.
Software testing- this is done manually and automatically to detect bugs.
Defect reporting- A QA engineer is responsible for log and track defects and works with developers to resolve them.

Roles of a project manager
Project planning- defining the scope, timeline, and resources needed for successful excecution.
Team coordination- Facillitating communnication and ensuring coordination between teams.
Risk management- Identifying the potentia risk and developing mitigation strategies.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Importance of IDEs and VCS
Code efficiency and produtivity- Provide features like syntax, highlighting, code completion and refactoring tools which help developers write and maintai codes more efficiently.
Debugging and Testing- many IDEs come with built-in debuggers that allow developers to set breakdowns, inspect variables and step through the execution of their programs.
Code Collaboration- many IDEs integrate with version control systems enabling developers to test and merge changes efficiently.
Example of IDEs include Visual Studio Code (Vs code)

Importance of Version Control Systems (vcs)
Backup and recovery- storing code in VCS ensures that it is not lost incase of accidental deletion or system failure.
Code Tracking and History- VCS maintains history of changes allowing developers to revert to previous versions if needed.
Example of VCS:
Git- a distributed VCS that allows developers to manage code locally and sync changes with remote repositories. Platforms like Githubs, Gitlabs and Bilbucket provide hosting for Git repositories.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
challenges include:
Keeping up the rapidly changing technology-strategy can be engaging in an open-source project to stay updated with modern practices.
Debugging complex issues- this can brinng about time consuming and sometimes can be too frustrating
strategy is to breakdown the problem into smaller components to isolate the issue.
Balancing speed and code quality- Developing software quickly without sacrificing quality is not easy.
strategy can be establishing coding standards and conducting regular code reviews.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit- it focuses on the individual components or functions of the software in isolation. Typically performed by developers and automated using testing frameworks.
Importance include: Helping catch the bugs early in development.

Integration Testing- Checks how different units or modules intereract when combined. it ensures that data flows correctly between integrated compnents.
Importance include: Dtecting issues related to commuunication between modules.

Ststem testing- evaluates the complex and integrated system against the specified requirements. mostly conducted in an environment that closely resembles production.
Importance: it ensures the entire system works as intended.

Acceptance testing- determines whether the software meets the business requirements and is ready for deployment.
importance: -validates real-world usage scenarios
            -ensures the software meets business or user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering refers the the art of crafting questions or statements to get the best feedback /responses from Artificial Intelligence (AI) models.
Importance of prompt engineering in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering has helped to improved customer experience while interacting with AI by getting clear and accurate responses from Artificial Intelligence.



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt
"Talk about industrialization"
Improved prompt
"Highlight the benefits of th fifth industrial revolution in regard to the innovations that come with it and how Sustainable technology has impacted the Greenhouse emmisions"
why improved prompt is more effective
a) spacificity- fifth industrial revelotion instead of industrialization
b) Clarity-Sustainable technology as the area of focus
c) Conciseness- as much as it is detailed, it goes straight to the ppoint
d) Relevance- it talks about greenhouse emmisions which is a real-world effect in the current world.
